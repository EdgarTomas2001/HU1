# Clustering Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various clustering algorithms for market analysis and pattern recognition.

## Components

### KMeansClustering
- Price pattern recognition
- Market state classification
- Trading signal generation based on cluster analysis

### HierarchicalClustering
- Market regime identification
- Trend change detection
- Multi-timeframe market structure analysis

### DBSCANClustering
- Outlier detection in price movements
- Anomaly detection in market behavior
- Dynamic support/resistance level identification

## Integration
These clustering algorithms work with the ChartManager's visualization system to display:
- Cluster boundaries and centers
- Market regime transitions
- Outlier events and anomalies
